In this project, you will develop create a small calculator for Set Algebra. This algebra is simplified, which only consists of integers, set of integers, predicates, integer operators, set operators, logical operators, and relational operators. This language is designed to be straightforward and simple, making it easier for you to implement. So, some features look wired. Please accept if you see any and consider them as intentional design choices. Before commencing work on the project, it is imperative that you thoroughly review this document. Note that is long. 
The input will be a source code file, which may include zero or multiple variable declarations (integer or set) and one single calculation expression. The calculator will then analyze the source code which is formulated in in Set Algebra. The analyzer should detect and highlight any errors presented in the source program; if no errors are found, the calculator will proceed with evaluation.
The first part of this document explains the languageâ€™s features with examples, which is like a programming language user manual. By reading it, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the language, enable them to write expressions in this language and to identify errors in source code. The subsequent part of the document outlines the instructions of implementation by different phases. Students are expected to complete the project by sequentially completing these 3 phases.
